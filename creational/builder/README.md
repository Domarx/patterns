Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that's used to encapsulate the construction logic for an object.
It is often used when the consturction process of an object is complex. The pattern is well suited for constructing 
different representations of the same class.

Purpose:

    [x] Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction
        process can create different representations
        
    [x] A common software creational design pattern that's used to encapsulate the construction logic for an object
